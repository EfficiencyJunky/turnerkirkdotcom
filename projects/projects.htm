        <h2>1) The FrankenPipe</h2>
        <h3>A Bagpipe MIDI Controller with RC Car Control</h3>
        
        I started this project in January of 2006 as an independent study at the 
        University of Miami.  Little did I know that it would quickly turn into an
        obsession of mine and one of my major passions in life.  <b>It won 1st Prize in
        The Student Design Competition at the 121st Audio Engineering Society Convention.</b><br />

        I am very fond of my invention although I know that it is far from finished.  It
        is cool to think that I actually accomplished something though and I intend
        to take the idea further and to levels even I don't know exist as of yet...

        <h2>2) Super Duper Destroytion!!!</h2>
        <h3>A MatLab GUI with 6 Digital Distortions using a Sine Wave and Guitar Sample as inputs</h3>
        I embarked on this project with my friend and classroom colleague Tim Yamaya.  We
        set out to create digital distortions that would show the full gamut of digital
        distortions from a complete hard clipping of the signal to a very "analog" sounding
        rounded off soft clipping distortion.

        download the GUI Directly below</h3>

        <b>To access the GUI:</b>
            <ol>
    				<li>extract the zip file to a directory</li>
            <li>Open up MatLab and set the "Current Directory" to be the same as the Destroytion directory.</li>
            <li>Type dgui in the MatLab "Command Window" and voila!  Super Duper Destroytion is yours!</li>
